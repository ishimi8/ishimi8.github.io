summary: A interactive simple game of inverse tic tac toe where you play against the computer. 
---

Inverse tic tac toe is a simple game that I programmed for my final project for ICS 111. Inverse tic tac toe is played just like regular tic tac toe but you have to play it so the other player gets 3 in a row. 

This project introduced me the very bare bone basics of game design as well as practice with other java features such as draw, responsive and sensor functions as well as clicking events. This project was very tedious to design because for the win conditions as well as how the computer responds to our move, I tried to code every possibility that could happen. This led to a ridiculous amount of code that I had to write, but it did however work. 

Later on the TA had showed the class a very optimal way of doing the assignment and it showed me that I should probably start thinking of smarter ways to code things rather than brute force it.
