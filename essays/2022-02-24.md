To a person with almost no artistic talent, UI Semantics was a god send as it did most of the formatting as well as design for you. It could help you neatly design icons, images, div boxes and organize them without the pain of calling position or moving over elements by 1px everytime to get it right. However, using raw HTML and CSS can give a lot more freedom with the options and tools they provide.

##Benefits of Using Raw HTML and CSS

Do you want to shove div boxes in the corner of your screen for some reason, sure it is possible with html and css, do you want to move something over just a little bit or make rainbow colored colored text sure you can do that. Just with HTML and CSS a person can make amazing websites given the time and effort as they are given a whole host of options for designing the web page. You are essentially given a blank canvas with HTML and CSS that in which you can create whatever you want. However what about the people who aren't so artistically inclined?

##UI Semantics Set Designs

Have you ever frustratingly tried to put three div boxes together or position a element just right but failed to do so as it is very hard to determine how many pixels or percents something actually needs to move in order to be exactly where you want it? This here is my main problem with raw HTML and CSS, I have to position things manually and even with the given float and percents, it still may look different on other people's screens as most people have different screen sizes. That is where UI Semantics comes in, it provides set values as well as useful classes to position elements all to help your website look more professional. Which is a aspect I personally love being someone who hates when a div box is just a bit a off or have trouble formatting my web page so that everything is in line. Despite these formats, someone would still be finding themselves using position to move some text down or color changes to get the color scheme just right.

##Conclusion

Which is why I think that UI semantics is a great tool that a person can use in their website design. It doesn't take some genius website architect to make professional looking website designs as most of the formats are given to you. No putting divs in a certain way or getting a image just right, the tools are right in front of you. UI semantics while great cannot do everything which is why I say that it is a great tool in addition to HTML and CSS as you still need some form of artistic input to make the website look just right.
